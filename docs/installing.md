# Installing CommyPanel

CommyPanel is installed on the server it manages. It controls Docker and nginx on that machine, so install it on a server you are happy to dedicate to your apps.

## Requirements

- A fresh or lightly used server running **Ubuntu 24.04**, **Ubuntu 26.04** or **Debian 13** (or newer), with systemd. Other systems are refused. Debian 12 is not supported because it ships PHP 8.2 and CommyPanel needs 8.3 or newer.
- `amd64` or `arm64`.
- Root access, and at least 1 GB of RAM (more if you build large apps on the server).
- Ports **80** and **443** free for your apps, and one more for the panel (**8443** by default).

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/commypanel/commypanel/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sudo bash
```

The installer downloads the release, checks its SHA-256 checksum and stops if it does not match, then installs everything and prints a **one-time setup link**. Open it, create your admin account, and you are done. The link works once and expires after an hour; run `sudo commypanel setup-url` for a new one.

Your browser will warn about the panel's certificate. It is self-signed until you give the panel a domain of its own.

Options: `--panel-port N` to choose another port, `--no-docker` if you manage Docker yourself, `--version X` to install a specific version.

| The `commypanel` command                                                                                                    | `/usr/local/bin/commypanel`                                                            |

It creates a `commypanel` system user for the web app and its workers, and these services:

- `commypanel-agent`: the only part that runs as root. It talks to Docker, nginx and Let's Encrypt on the panel's behalf, over a local socket that only the `commypanel` user can use.
- `commypanel-queue@1`, `commypanel-queue@2`: run deployments and certificate requests.
- `commypanel-scheduler`: re-checks domains and renews certificates.

The panel's PHP code is owned by root and read-only to the panel user. PHP comes from your distribution's packages, so security fixes arrive through normal `apt upgrade`.

nginx's default site is disabled, because CommyPanel installs its own catch-all site for certificate validation.

## Firewall

CommyPanel does not change your firewall. Open ports 80, 443 and the panel port, for example with ufw:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 80,443,8443/tcp
```

## Upgrading

```bash
sudo commypanel upgrade
```

An upgrade downloads and verifies the new release, backs up the panel databases (the five newest backups are kept in `/var/lib/commypanel/backups`), migrates them, switches over and restarts the services. If the new version does not come up healthy, the previous release is started again. Running the installer again does the same thing.

## Command line

```
sudo commypanel setup-url          one-time link to create the first admin
sudo commypanel admin:reset EMAIL  new random password for an admin, and turns off its 2FA
sudo commypanel status             version, services and panel address
sudo commypanel logs               follow the logs
sudo commypanel upgrade            upgrade
```

If you lose access to your admin account, `admin:reset` is the way back in.

## Uninstalling

There is no uninstall command yet. Your apps run as Docker containers and keep running if the panel is removed. To remove CommyPanel by hand, stop and disable the `commypanel-*` services, delete their unit files, `/etc/nginx/conf.d/*-commypanel*.conf` and `/etc/nginx/commypanel`, then `/opt/commypanel`. Keep `/var/lib/commypanel` if you may reinstall.

## Troubleshooting

- The full installer log is in `/var/log/commypanel-install.log`.
- `sudo commypanel status` shows which service is down; `sudo journalctl -u commypanel-agent -n 50` shows why.
- "Port 80 is already used by ...": another web server is running. Stop and disable it first.
